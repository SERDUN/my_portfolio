In usecases described basic feature for separated logic, at current moment  we haven't difficult logic and therefore there are only convertng dto to mapper and handling base exceptions.\n About domain presenter: Using BLoC for getting data and handle cases.

Kotlin helped us reduce the amount of code compared to Java. We used the RxKotlin framework built on the basis of the Paternal Observer pattern. RxKotlin gave us the possibility to subscribe to events and work more conveniently with the background streams that are most actively used when requesting a server with the help of the Retrofit framework. To implement all of our client’s ideas, we chose Google Maps because they allowed us to customize the marker that helps users see how busy a certain place is. As the app features photos of different places, we used the Glide library to cache photos. The Dexter libraries were excellent for permission queries and added more convenience. With Dexter, it's easy to ask users for permission to record data to the phone's memory or access the camera or geolocation features.",

It allowed us to save time on app development since we could write code once and run it on both Android and iOS. This allowed Eric to test his idea on both Android and iPhone users. We needed to display nearby users on a dynamic map with a radar overlay. Google Maps seemed like the perfect option, but at the time Flutter didn’t offer full support for Google Maps, meaning we couldn’t change the color scheme and customize markers. We decided to work around this by building these features from scratch. Today, Flutter already offers full support for Google Maps, so this is no longer a concern for new apps.",
