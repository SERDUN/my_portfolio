      "description": "The Android app was built using the MVP design pattern, which allowed us to split the business logic from the UI perfectly. To write the app, we chose Kotlin. Kotlin helped us reduce the amount of code compared to Java. We used the RxKotlin framework built on the basis of the Paternal Observer pattern. RxKotlin gave us the possibility to subscribe to events and work more conveniently with the background streams that are most actively used when requesting a server with the help of the Retrofit framework. To implement all of our client’s ideas, we chose Google Maps because they allowed us to customize the marker that helps users see how busy a certain place is. As the app features photos of different places, we used the Glide library to cache photos. The Dexter libraries were excellent for permission queries and added more convenience. With Dexter, it's easy to ask users for permission to record data to the phone's memory or access the camera or geolocation features.",      "linkAndroid": "",

In-app realized mechanics, which connect classic user posts with maps, this mechanic allows looking at where the post was created. \n\nFor the project organize was used clean architecture, but in this project was skipped \"use case layer\", but this step was mistaken since some presenters have kept logic that emitted problems when need add change.\n\nIn general, for presenter used BloC but to keep global data I used redux which is too much I think now, it would be more concise to use Provider(InheritedWidget) to observe global data.\n\nMost challenges in this project were actualizing and syncing data to map visualization like markers. Because the app has many triggers which force to get updates from the server.\n\nAnd next challenge was in working with video and images which didn't compress on the server-side but after some writing line codes  and some additional loaders I compressed media on the mobile side which allow me to save much memory    \n" ,
